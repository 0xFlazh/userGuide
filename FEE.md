# 0xFlazh Fee overview

## Fees

The fees are based on marker and taker model (0.1% for takers, 0.05% for makers), and the admin account is only allowed to decrease the fees.
Previously, take fees were paid in the token being received by the taker. Now they (along with make fees and rebates) are paid in the token being given by the taker. This simplifies the fee calculus.
